        <h1>"कचरे का प्रबंधन"
            kachare ka prabandhan  -> Waste Management</h1>
        <h5>As the human population and overconsumption grow, the waste we produce becomes harder to get rid of.
            With adequate waste management, we tend to think that waste does not affect us. Out of sight, out of mind, right? Not so much anymore.
            The problem with our waste is a lot harder to ignore now. We have everyday factors such as illegal dumpsites 
            and clogged drainage systems to remind us. In some regions around the world, communities 
            are being encroached by landfills. People live in close proximity to waste dumps with no foreseeable change.
            On a grander scale, we have issues such as ocean pollution, global warming, air pollution, and environmental degradation.
            All the issues mentioned have negative consequences on the quality of life; not just for humans, but unknowing plants and animals.
            It is evident that we need to inform ourselves about the effects of excess waste production and improper waste management.
            Many influential individuals and activists are lending their voices to raise awareness of waste recycling. From powerful speeches 
            and conversations across the globe, here are 34 relevant waste quotes we should all remember.</p>

            <h1>Exploring the three R's of Waste Management</h1>
            <p>In order to keep as much material out of the landfill as possible, 
               it’s important for each of us to do our p art. One of the ways to put 
               that plan into action is through the 3 Rs of waste management —Reduce, Reuse, Recycle.</p>
             
            <div class="row">
                <div class="management-col">
                       <h3>Reduce</h3>
                       <p> By reducing, you stop the problem at the source. Making less waste to begin with means there’s less waste to clean up.</p> 
                </div>
                    <div class="management-col">
                   <h3>Reuse</h3>
                  <p>Reusing is taking old or unwanted items you might otherwise throw away and finding a new use for them.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="management-col">
                   <h3>Recycle</h3>
                  <p>Recycling is the last — and most commonly used — of the 3 Rs. Recycling is changing discarded materials into new products.</p>
